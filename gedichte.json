Euphoria chokes her, making her current life more likely to stay. \nAfter Venus sculpted her, she was showered in the rain, \nall the blessings, all the gifts started to make her feel insane. \nA fountain. She was showered with gifts - Oh but what an ugly feeling it is to be a misfit.",

Eternalize it, please show me, in every moment how to really pose.\nI watch you laugh through the lenses of my cam,  the moment isnt printed on my senses but at least I can show everyone who I think I am. \nFull moon washes away all my worries, all my sins but I get another picture so I can post it on my pin.\nPlease dont be irritated when I cant answer how life has been this far, but wait let me check my life is on my micro sd card.",
